      What Is Real Estate?
Real estate is defined as the land and any permanent structures, like a home, or improvements attached to the land, whether natural or artificial.

Real estate is a form of real property. It differs from personal property, which is not permanently attached to the land, such as vehicles, boats, jewelry, furniture, and farm equipment.

Key Takeaways
Real estate is considered real property that includes land and anything permanently attached to it or built on it, whether natural or artificial.
There are five main categories of real estate, which include residential, commercial, industrial, raw land, and special use.
Investing in real estate includes purchasing a home, a rental property, or land.
Indirect investment in real estate can be made via REITs or through pooled real estate investment.
Real Estate
Understanding Real Estate
The terms land, real estate, and real property are often used interchangeably, but there are distinctions.

Land refers to the earth's surface down to the center of the planet, including the trees, minerals, and water. The physical characteristics of land include its immobility, indestructibility, and uniqueness, where each parcel of land differs geographically.

Real estate encompasses the land, plus any permanent artificial additions, such as houses and other buildings. Any additions or changes to the land that affect the property's value are called an improvement.

Once land is improved, the total capital and labor used to build the improvement represent a sizable fixed investment. Though a building can be razed, improvements like drainage, electricity, water, and sewer systems tend to be permanent.

Real property includes the land and additions to the land, plus the rights inherent to its ownership and usage.

Real Estate Agent
A real estate agent is a licensed professional who arranges real estate transactions, matching buyers and sellers and acting as their representatives in negotiations.

What Are Types of Real Estate?
Residential real estate: Any property used for residential purposes. Examples include single-family homes, condos, cooperatives, duplexes, townhouses, and multifamily residences.

Commercial real estate: Any property used exclusively for business purposes, such as apartment complexes, gas stations, grocery stores, hospitals, hotels, offices, parking facilities, restaurants, shopping centers, stores, and theaters.
